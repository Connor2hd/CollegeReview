# CollegeReviews.ca
This is a website I created to facilitate reviews of college programs in Ontario.  I hope to expand the database to include universities and
other schools in the rest of Canada.

### Tools and Technology Implemented
The pages are comprised of HTML and PHP.  I used the Bootstrap framework for ease of use and efficiant scaling accross devices.  The PHP interacts
with a Microsoft SQL database that is hosted on Azure.  In order to limit the amount the site can be exploited I have implemented Google's
Google's [reCaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/) system.  I did not want to implement a login system for a couple of reasons.
The first being that this is primarily a portfolio piece I plan on expansing on to showcase my PHP skills.  The second reason being that
a user would not want to sign up to a site to post only one review.  In the future I may add Facebook login in an attempt to lower abuse.
